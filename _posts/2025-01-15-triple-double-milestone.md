## What is the Triple-Double?

In basketball, a triple-double means achieving double digits in three statistical categories in a single game. For our lab, we've achieved our own version:

1. **Double-digit funding growth** - Securing over $4M in new grants
2. **Doubled research team size** - Expanding from 2 to 7+ Ph.D. students
3. **Double-digit publications** - Publishing 10+ papers in high-impact journals

## Major Funding Achievements

This year brought unprecedented funding success:

- **NSF NRT Grant ($3M)**: Co-PI on "Smart Agriculture Energy Innovation Network" building workforce for sustainable rural energy communities
- **DOE TEAMER Program ($171K)**: PI on reliability analysis of infinitely variable transmissions for tidal energy converters
- **NSF EPSCoR Grant ($300K)**: PI on predictive condition monitoring for distributed wind energy using blockchain technology
- **NSF PFI-TT Grant ($550K)**: Co-PI on novel IVT technology for tidal current energy harvesting

## Research Team Expansion

Our team has grown significantly with talented new Ph.D. students:

- **William Mayfield** - Working on federated learning frameworks for distributed wind systems
- **Youssef En-Nali** - Joining to work on AI-enabled predictive maintenance
- **Eli Herrington** - Focusing on renewable energy integration
- **Sara Mouafik** - Advancing AI forecasting for energy systems
- **Doha Bounaim** - Developing time-series forecasting models
- **Obed Kamulegeya** - Contributing to smart infrastructure research
- **Zaki Moutassem** - Completing dissertation on physics-informed deep learning

## Research Breakthroughs

Our expanded team has produced impressive research output:

### AI-Powered Energy Forecasting
Published groundbreaking work on multivariate CNN-Bi-LSTM models for wind-to-hydrogen production forecasting in the *International Journal of Hydrogen Energy*.

### Physics-Informed Deep Learning
Zaki Moutassem's research on CNN-LSTM architectures enhanced with physical domain knowledge was featured in *Algorithms*, advancing predictive maintenance for underground power cables.

### Federated Learning for Wind Systems
Developed privacy-preserving frameworks for distributed wind system monitoring, presented at ASME ES2025.

### Advanced Drivetrain Technologies
Continued innovation in infinitely variable transmissions, with new analytical models published in *Mechanism and Machine Theory*.

## Recognition and Awards

This growth has been recognized by the university and broader community:

- **2024 Junior Faculty Outstanding Research Award** from MSU College of Engineering
- **NSF I-Corps Best Accomplishment Award** for technology commercialization
- **DOE EnergyTech UP Faculty Explorer Award** for energy innovation

## Looking Forward

With this strong foundation, we're positioned to make an even greater impact in 2026:

- Expanding collaborations with national laboratories and industry partners
- Launching new research initiatives in hydrogen production and storage
- Growing our team with additional talented graduate students
- Advancing technology transfer through our Transfinity IVT commercialization
