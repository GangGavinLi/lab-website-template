## Technology Transfer

Several of our technologies are being developed for commercialization:

- **Transfinity IVT**: Novel transmission system for tidal energy (NSF I-Corps, TEDCO-MII Grant)
- **ScanMaster**: Mirror-assisted continuously scanning laser vibrometry (TEDCO-MII Grant)
- **Windmaster**: Improved hybrid vertical axis wind turbine (TEDCO-MII Grant)

These innovations have the potential to significantly impact renewable energy deployment and infrastructure monitoring.
